This is a simple project made in order to help me learn C#.

Comes with the following features: 
* Adding and removing habits
* Adding and removing completions
* A functioning, but incredibly bad UX, TUI
* 100% (as of writing) code coverage
* Completion Streaks (max and current)
* Importing from Habitica
